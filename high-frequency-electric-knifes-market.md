<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Frequency Electric Knifes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopolar Circuit</li><li>Bipolar Circuit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The high-frequency electric knives market is primarily categorized into two types: monopolar and bipolar circuits. Monopolar circuits use a single electrode to cut tissue while returning current through a neutral electrode placed elsewhere on the body. This method is widely used for cutting and coagulating. In contrast, bipolar circuits utilize two active electrodes to deliver current directly between them, enhancing precision and reducing damage to surrounding tissues. Both types are integral in surgical settings, offering different advantages based on surgical needs.</p></p>
