<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-invasive Breathing Technological Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive-pressure</li><li>Negative-pressure</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The non-invasive breathing technology market comprises two primary types: positive-pressure and negative-pressure systems. Positive-pressure devices, such as CPAP machines, deliver air into the airways to maintain open passages, commonly used in sleep apnea treatment. In contrast, negative-pressure systems, like ventilators and bubble oxygen therapy, create a vacuum to assist in lung expansion and improve oxygenation. Both systems aim to enhance respiratory support without invasive procedures, catering to different medical needs and patient populations.</p></p>
